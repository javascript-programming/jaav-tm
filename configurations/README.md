These are predefined configs for a network setup

- `single` is a network consisting of one node. Mostly used in dev-mode.
- `node0` and `node1` are for setting up a network of two nodes. Currently deployed on 5.157.85.76 and 5.157.85.181

The configuration is done in the `config`/config.toml` file.
